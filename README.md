# Exercise cloud computing (HITO 0)
# Exercise 1:

The example of application: Restaurant reservation.
The microservice architecture pattern would be a layered architecture.
The evolving to a microservice architecture: The figure above represents a simplified diagram of what the application based on the Microservices architecture could look like. This application displays, for example, an available restaurant. This "restaurant board" therefore consists, for example, of a photo, a description of the restaurant's menu or offers, and an address. In the diagram, the user interface uses a Microservice for each component to be filled in.  Thus, the latter can make a REST request to Microservice A, which manages the photos of the restaurants and their dishes, in order to obtain those corresponding to the restaurant to be displayed. Similarly, Microservices B and C deal respectively with the other descriptions.
